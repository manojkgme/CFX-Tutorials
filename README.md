# CFX Tutorials
 Tutorials created for the ocean engineering under graduate students. The tutorial details different stages involved in the simulation of wave structure interaction using the CFX software in the ANSYS CFD Suite. Two different problems are considered in this tutorial.
1. **Wave interaction with horizontal plate.**
2. **Wave interaction with cylinder.**

Any computational fluid dynamics simulation involves the following stages.  

1. **Establishing/Understanding the domain to be simulated.**  
In this stage, the physical area/region to be simulated in considered. It is important to have a larger outlook at this stage. The actual scale of the physical process, various regions of interest, measurement locations etc, are identified and estiblished at this stage.
2. **Determining/Specifying the area and physics to be simulated.**  
In many cases, during simulation we can get away with simulating only a part of the physical domain. For example, in the case of a large wave flume that is 30.0 m long, we might not have to simulate the entire physical domain in very high resolution to study a process/event. Instead a small area can be simulated by adopting techniques such as weak coupling and system modelling. By using these techniques the simulation physics and domain can be optimized.
3. **Creating the geometry**  
The geometry can be created either using a 3D modelling software or using the meshing tool. In this tutorial, the geometry is created using Autodesk(R) inventor and exported as an IGES file. This geometry is then imported into the meshing tool (ICEM CFD).
4. **Creating the mesh**  
The geometry imported into ICEM CFD is then meshed based on the problem and boundary conditions. While using turbulence models, the boundary effects should be modelled properly for a stable simulation. This can be achieved by optimizing the mesh for [Y plus](https://www.computationalfluiddynamics.com.au/tips-tricks-turbulence-wall-functions-and-y-requirements/#:~:text=The%20y%2B%20value%20is%20a,are%20within%20a%20certain%20range.) values
